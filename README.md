Learning exercise in python3 parallelization/multiprocessing using basic library features (no pools) in order to better understand the context of threads and processes in python projects.
Also implementing what I have learnt in pyqt course.
Should have a very lightweight and simple but secure python communication system utilizing qt GUI for client, tcp-sockets, parallel-processes, commandline interface for spawning backend server..
